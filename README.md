The breast cancer dataset was cleaned, encoded, and standardized for binary classification. SVMs with linear and RBF kernels were trained and visualized using PCA for 2D decision boundaries. Hyperparameters (C and gamma) were tuned with GridSearchCV, and model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and test accuracy metrics.
